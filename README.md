# openHAB Jython Utilities

This repository contains [Jython](http://www.jython.org) code for use the [openHAB](http://www.openhab.org) [1.8.x](https://github.com/openhab/openhab/tree/1.8). This is primarily for my own use but I'm making it available to others in case they find it useful.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/steve-bate/openhab-jython/wiki) for more information.
